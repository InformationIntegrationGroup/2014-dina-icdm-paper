Data mining tasks typically require significant effort in data preparation to find, transform, integrate and prepare the data for the relevant data mining tools.  In addition, the work performed in data preparation is often not recorded and is difficult to reproduce from the raw data.  In this paper we present an integrated approach to data preparation and data mining that combines the two steps into a single integrated process and maintains detailed metadata about the data sources, the steps in the process, and the resulting learned classifier produced from data mining algorithms.  We present results on an example scenario, which shows that our approach provides significant reduction in the time in takes to perform a data mining task.

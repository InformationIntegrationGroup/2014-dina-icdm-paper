\section{Discussion}
This paper presented a unified approach to data preparation and mining using the data integration system, Karma. We discussed an end-to-end approach of data preparation and data mining, which consists of various transformations applied on a data set, publishing the data as RDFs, joining different data sets based on their mapping to the ontology, modeling the data mining services to a domain model, and invoking theses services with the published data. Our work on Karma provided us with a platform to record the various transformations that the user performs in preparing the raw data set to its desired form. We achieved a significant improvement in reducing the time taken for this iterative process of data preparation by replaying the transformations the user performed on the first file on all the other files in our data set. We also showed how services could be modeled using semantics and reused by publishing them as linked data.
